  - paragraph: Maxing Siphon Life allows you to siphon more often, for longer, and more damage (hence life recovered). Most players won’t sit in it, but a few ticks can be enough to win the fight. Maxing Shoulder Charge second allows you to do it more often, go further each time, and finally give yourself a damage buff after bouldering your opponents into a wall. Although Infernal Resilience is a passive skill, it is the key to the champion’s toughness. It’s common to max first, and maxing it gives you more health and more health regen making you even tougher.
